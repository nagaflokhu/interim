* =sledge/tests/mario.l=

The data files are somewhere in the git history of the repository.  By
knowing that the format of =mario.888= and =smb3.888= is 32 bits RGBA
(see =notes/mksprite.sh=), one can guess the dimensions of the
original files from their file sizes.  It's a bit easier if you look
at the (unused?) ~font-pitch~ variables which is double the width.
Anyway, with this information, it's relatively simple to reconstruct
the source files:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
convert -size 200x241 -depth 8 rgba:mario.888 mario.png
convert -size 493x493 -depth 8 rgba:smb3.888 smb3.png
#+END_SRC
